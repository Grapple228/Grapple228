## Currently Working On

I am developing a personal project that is currently in the development stage. At the moment, I'm creating useful libraries that will be utilized in this project.

I have already planned the architecture, including how the components will communicate, the necessary functionality, and their purposes.

The project is a microservice application that utilizes ScyllaDB, Valkey caching, Kafka as a message broker, and real-time communication over WebSockets via the gRPC protocol, all built in Rust. There are also will be used OAuth 2.1 + OIDC authentication and authorization.

## Projects

### [CSV Reader](https://github.com/Grapple228/CSV-Reader-V2) - My First Program (C#)

This is the second version of a program I wrote for a coding interview. I know it has its flaws, but it holds sentimental value as my starting point. Whenever I feel discouraged, I look back at it and remember how far I've come.

You can also find the [first](https://github.com/Grapple228/CSV-Reader-V1) version, but I recommend not looking at it unless you're curious.

### [OneC Tool](https://github.com/Grapple228/OneCTool) - 1C Parsing Program (C#)

I developed this tool to parse large CSV files and insert the necessary data into a 1C database. It saved me a lot of time.

### [Music App](https://github.com/Grapple228/MusicApp-Final) - My College Diploma Project (C#)

This was my first full-stack application, featuring microservices, a message broker, and a database. The idea was to create a simple and useful app for listening to music with friends.

Through this project, I learned how the MVVM pattern works, how to develop views and models, and what backend technologies are best for performance (though I still have room for improvement).

You can also check out the clumsy first version to see how much I've improved over three months: [Old Version](https://github.com/Grapple228/MusicApp-Old-version).

### Project Templates (Rust)

I have created several project templates for rapid development. They utilize the Cargo generate feature, allowing me to easily create projects with a good and scalable structure using a single command.

You can find the [common template](https://github.com/Grapple228/rust-base) and the [workspace template](https://github.com/Grapple228/rust-workspace-base).

### [Tinkoff Investments](https://github.com/Grapple228/rust-investments-tinkoff) - Tinkoff gRPC Client (Rust)

I created this for personal use to analyze my investments. It also served as a way to understand how gRPC works.

I've published it on crates.io, and it has received over 5,500 downloads at this moment.

### [grapple_utils](https://github.com/Grapple228/rust_grapple_utils) - Library with Useful Features (Rust)

This library simplifies working with strings, environment variables, parsing UUIDs, and handling time across my projects.

### [grapple_db](https://github.com/Grapple228/rust_grapple_db) - Library for Database Communication (Rust)

This is my latest project, developed for my current work. I found that many database clients are overly complicated, so I created my own. Currently, it works only with Scylla and Redis, but I plan to implement support for MongoDB and PostgreSQL.

### Research Repositories

I also have numerous repositories for my small research projects.

### Other projects

Before I started to learn C# I worked in 1C where developed shell for managing keys as my side college project. I spoke about this project at a conference where I won first place. There are [docs](https://disk.yandex.ru/d/3Ahlq0XkIqdSlw).

I also participated in the international Olympiad from IT-Planet on RESTful service development. I went through all the stages, reaching the final, where I took 4th place. There are repos with code: [Stage 1](https://github.com/Grapple228/If_Else_Stage_1), [Stage 2](https://github.com/Grapple228/If_Else_Stage_2), [Final](https://github.com/Grapple228/If_Else_Stage_3).

I have worked on Excel VBA macros, creating a program to generate Word documents from data in spreadsheets. This saved me dozens of hours while I was in the Army.

## Interests

I am passionate about software development and exploring new technologies. In my free time, I enjoy reading programming books and learning about new features.
